## Unit Testing with Mocha and Chai
<p>Unit testing means testing the behavior of code in small, independent units.<br> 
Units are typically designed to be the smallest meaningful chunk of independently testable code. <br>
Mocha and Chai are two JavaScript frameworks commonly used together for unit testing.<br>
Mocha is a testing framework that provides functions that are executed according in a specific order, 
and that logs their results to the terminal window.<br>
Chai is an assertion library that is often used alongside Mocha. It provides functions and methods that help you compare the output of a certain test with its expected value. 
Chai provides clean syntax that almost reads like English!
